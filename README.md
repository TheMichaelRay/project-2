###Overview
--
This webapp was designed with the purpose of creating a community of positive people that lift others up when they accomplish amazing things. 

Since so much of the internet is devoted to tearing people down and arguing, I wanted to create a place that was only used to build people up.

###How May I Join?

The site is hosted online [here](https://fierce-hollows-46180.herokuapp.com/) through heroku. Create an account with secure login info and an encrypted password.
